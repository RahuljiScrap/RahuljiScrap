# Description

**Details**

ScrapRecycle is an single page application with a well structured layout, where you view both information  of the web app and order food items by adding them to the cart. 

The application let you see both the name and image of each product then gives you the flexibility to add between one to five 5 items to the cart at once with a single button click. 


**Technologies**

Technologies i used to build this are  React.js, Css, react-bootstrap, react-scroll, animation on scroll library, sweetalert.js library

I used React.js framework to bootstrap this project because of the limitless functionalities and flexibilities it brings to me, examples of the these are : 

- useContext hook which i used this to manage the state of some components in my application which includes the functioning cart system
- Props to pass some data from component to component with ease.
- Access to 3rd party libraries that made the app much better like react-scroll and react-bootstrap, 

I then used animation on scroll for the scroll animation and sweetalert for the order validation.
